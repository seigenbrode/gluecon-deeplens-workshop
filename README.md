This 2-hour workshop was created to demonstrate the ability to build and deploy machine learning models to the edge using [AWS DeepLens](https://aws.amazon.com/deeplens/).  The final module (optional - pending time) demonstrates the ability to build and deploy your own model to your DeepLens device. 

## Workshop Modules:

1 - [Pre-Requisites & Getting to know your Deep Lens](../master/1-PreReq-Device/README.md) - (15 Minutes) 

2 - [Object Detection with DeepLens](../master/2-Object-Detection/README.md) - (40 Minutes) 

3 - [Build Image Classification Model w/ Amazon SageMaker](../master/3-Bring-Your-Own-Model/README.md) - *Optional* (40 Minutes)
