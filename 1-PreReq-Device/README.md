# Getting to know your Deep Lens

## 1- Get to know your Device
  
AWS DeepLens is a wireless video camera and API. It shows you how to use the latest Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and technology to develop computer vision applications. Through examples and tutorials, AWS DeepLens gives you hands-on experience using a physical camera to run real-time computer vision models.

The AWS DeepLens camera, or device, uses deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze visual imagery. You use the device as a development environment to build computer vision applications.

AWS DeepLens is optimized for Apache MXNet. You can also use other AWS services with DeepLens including:
- [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/), for model training and validation
- [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), for running inference against CNN models
- [AWS IoT Greengrass](https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass/), for deploying updates and functions to your device



## 2 -  AWS DeepLens Hardware
The AWS DeepLens camera includes the following:

- A 4-megapixel camera with MJPEG (Motion JPEG)
- 8 GB of on-board memory
- 16 GB of storage capacity
- A 32-GB SD (Secure Digital) card
- WiFi support for both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz standard dual-band networking
- A micro HDMI display port
- Audio out and USB ports

The AWS DeepLens camera is powered by an IntelÂ® Atom Processor, which can process 100 billion floating-point operations per second (GFLOPS). This gives you all of the compute power that you need to perform inference on your device. The micro HDMI display port, audio out, and USB ports allow you to attach peripherals, so you can get creative with your computer vision applications.

## 3 - Registering your device:

**Note**: When working with a new Deep Lens device there is a process required to register your device.  **For this workshop we have pre-registered your devices to save time**

If you are interested in exploring the DeepLens registration process after this lab, you are encouraged to explore the detailed documentation for [registering your AWS DeepLens](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/deeplens/latest/dg/deeplens-getting-started-register.html).
